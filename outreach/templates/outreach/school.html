                Currently, we provide free tuition for 180 pupils at our temporary site while we eagerly anticipate the move to our permanent location upon its construction. This transition will allow us to expand both the primary and secondary sections, opening our doors to even more students.

We are proud to introduce our school, which is dedicated to educating underprivileged children in the FHA community, Abuja, FCT, Nigeria. Our mission is simple but critical: to ensure that every child, regardless of their background, has access to quality education.

In today’s world, it is more important than ever to invest in the education of less fortunate children. Historically, children from poor backgrounds were often left to suffer unimaginable hardships, from genital mutilation to abuse and slavery. We aim to change that narrative.

Our Mission: Transforming Lives Through Free Education
We embarked on this journey of providing free education to underprivileged children in our community to break the cycle of illiteracy, poverty, and exploitation. By offering these children a chance to learn, we are not only building their futures but also increasing productivity and fostering prosperity in our community.

​

Our Vision: Empowering the Marginalized
Our vision is to reduce illiteracy in marginalized communities throughout Nigeria. We believe that education is the key to social equality and to improving the overall quality of life. We want to give every child the tools to realize their potential, regardless of their socioeconomic status.

​

Our Objectives: Building Bright Futures
Academic Impact: Provide a strong academic foundation to underprivileged children.

Protecting Rights: Safeguard the rights of children through education and advocacy.

Talent Development: Unleash the hidden talents, skills, and career potential of every child we serve.

Global Integration: Equip them with the knowledge and skills necessary to thrive in a globalized world.

Civic Responsibility: Inspire them to become responsible, contributing citizens who will influence prosperity in their communities. 

Challenges and Opportunities
As word of our work has spread, we've seen an influx of new pupils, pushing our current capacity to its limits. While we are equipped to handle 108 students, the arrival of 72 additional pupils has created an urgent need for increased resources and infrastructure. We believe that with your support, we can overcome these challenges and continue to grow.

 

Why Your Support Matters

By supporting our cause, you will be helping to reshape the future of hundreds of children who would otherwise be left behind. Together, we can create opportunities, transform lives, and build a better future for these children and the entire community.

We invite you to join us on this meaningful journey of education, empowerment, and transformation. With your help, we can expand our reach, improve our facilities, and provide even more children with the education they deserve.
